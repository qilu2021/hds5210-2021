Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

Nice work overall.  Your code was easy to follow and your documentation helped make the journey through your notebook clear.

Noting the population density outliers was insightful. Think about what you might do to manage that?  Do you think population density is a driver of other outcomes?  If so, since MO only has only 2-3 outlier regions based on population density.  Could you look at a broader geography, including a wider range of population densities and a larger number of samples?  That is, bring in more cities.
